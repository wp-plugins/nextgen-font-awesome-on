1. Upload `nextgen-fa-on.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this do? =

NextGEN Gallery includes a Font Awesome script in the plugin. But the script is used in NextGEN Plus and Pro only. Additionally, the script is only called when a Pro style gallery (from Plus/Pro) is visible on a page or post. This plugin makes the Font Awesome script available to use all the time on your WordPress website.

= What can I do with Font Awesome? =

With Font Awesome active all the time, you can use the icon fonts anywhere on your site with basic HTML or CSS.  Visit the <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a> site to learn more.

= Can you provide an example? =

Sure!  Use the following anywhere on your website and you'll see the WordPress logo display from Font Awesome.

`<i class="fa fa-wordpress"></i>`

= What if I have another Font Awesome plugin active? =

NextGEN Gallery is designed to utilize Font Awesome being called from another plugin, or theme. So there should be no Font Awesome conflicts as NextGEN's call of the script will not happen in that situation.

== Screenshots ==

1. When both NextGEN Font Awesome On and NextGEN Gallery are both active, you will see Font Awesome included in the source code of every page. If you are using another Font Awesome plugin, then NextGEN Gallery will not serve the Font Awesome script.
